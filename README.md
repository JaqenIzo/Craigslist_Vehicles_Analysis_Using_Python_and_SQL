# Craiglist Vehicle Analysis Using SQL and Python Database Connector

**A continuation of the craigslist time series data for completion of LUX DEV Bootcamp**

**Craigslist is a website that lists vehicles available for sale.**

**I am Attempting to do a data analysis on a dataset provided in my just completed LUX DEV Data Science for Everyone Bootcamp. I uploaded the dataset to an SQL server and I'll be querying it directly from the server and giving key insights on the data by plotting using matplotlib and doing data transformation using numpy and pandas and pyodbc SQL connection library**
